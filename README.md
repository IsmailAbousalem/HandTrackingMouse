# HandTrackingMouse
Experience touchless interaction with your computer via my Python/AI project! Control your mouse with gesture-based hand tracking.

# PyAutoGUI, cv2, and MediaPipe are used to track and detect the hand and plot different points onto the fingers. The pink border on screen is related to the edge of the computer screen. If you move your finger to the edge of the pink box, you are at the edge of your monitor.

# Using your pointer finger, the AI and can detect where each landmark (plotted points) are for each finger and determine what position they are in. If all fingers are down, except the pointer finger, this registers as me taking control of the cursor movement.

# If both fingers are up, it is detected as a click.
